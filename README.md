# BOC Team Project

This will be out team's main repository for data and coding.  
It will serve as the central place where each member uploads their datasets and code, and later where we combine everything into the shared project.

## Getting Started (For All Team Members)

### Step 1. Sign into GitHub
- Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log in.  

### Step 2. Accept the invite
- I sent an invite to your emails already to collaborate on this repo:  
  [https://github.com/skp1008/BOC-Team-Project](https://github.com/skp1008/BOC-Team-Project)  
- Open the email and click **Accept Invitation**.  

### Step 3. Go to the repository and find your folder
- After accepting, go to the repo page:  
  [https://github.com/skp1008/BOC-Team-Project](https://github.com/skp1008/BOC-Team-Project)  
- Open the **members** folder.  
- Find the folder with **your name** on it.  

### Step 5. Upload your files
- Click into your personal folder.  
- Click **Add file → Upload files**.  
- Drag and drop your datasets, code, or any work you have done.  
- Scroll down and click **Commit changes**.

## Why this setup?
- Everyone’s work is in one place and visible to all.  
- Each person’s work stays separate, so files don’t overwrite each other.  
- Later, we will use the **project** folder to build the final combined project together.
