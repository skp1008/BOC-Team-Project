# BOC Team Project

This will be out team's main repository for data and coding.  
It will serve as the central place where each member uploads their datasets and code, and later where we combine everything into the shared project.

## Repository Structure (folders)
- **Main/** – Main project files (where we’ll work together on the final combined code)  
- **Members/** – Each team member has their own folder here for personal uploads  
  - **krishna/** – Krishna’s files  
  - **[other members will also have their own folders]**  
- **README.md** – Project information and setup instructions

## Why this setup?

- Later, we will use the **project** folder to build the final combined project together.
