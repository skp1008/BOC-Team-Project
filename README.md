# BOC Team Project

This repository is for our group’s BOC Team Project.  
It will serve as the central place where each member uploads their datasets and code, and later where we combine everything into the shared project.

---

## Project Structure
- **project/** – Main project files (where we’ll work together on the final combined code)  
- **members/** – Each team member has their own folder here for personal uploads  
  - **krishna/** – Krishna’s work directory  
  - **[other members will also have their own folders]**  
- **README.md** – Project information and setup instructions

## Why this setup?
- Everyone’s work is in one place and visible to all.  
- Each person’s work stays separate, so files don’t overwrite each other.  
- Later, we will use the **project** folder to build the final combined project together.
